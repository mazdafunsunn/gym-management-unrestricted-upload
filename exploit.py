# Tested using: Python 3.8.3
# Vulnerability Description:
# Gym Management System 1.0 suffers from an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability allowing attackers to gain Remote Code Execution by uploading a malicious PHP file.
#
# The /up.php page allows unauthenticated users to upload a file along with "name" and "ext" parameters, processes it further if the content type indicates it's an image, then saves it as "<name>.<ext>".
# As we fully control the uploaded filepath we can now upload a file anywhere on the machine, so we can now upload our malicious PHP file to the current directory and access it from the page's root.
